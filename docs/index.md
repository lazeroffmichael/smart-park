## Description

Parking lots and garages, especially in the areas where large numbers of vehicles arrive at the same time, have problems 
with traffic congestion. The goal of this project is to develop an IoT system to provide information about free parking 
spots and also to optimize the traffic in parking lots and garages, targeting one of the crucial needs of a Smart City. 
The key components of the system are the driver’s smartphone, the parking app (to be developed as part of this project), 
an embedded system installed in the car, and cloud service to collect and interchange the data (IoT architecture). 
The mobile app will monitor the driver’s behavior and detect when the driver is approaching the car. This information 
will be sent to the cloud and shared with drivers who are searching for a parking spot. The embedded system in the car 
will include a GPS receiver to post periodic vehicle location to the cloud and sense adjacent parking spots to provide 
additional information. The system will be able to provide the information about occupancy in each lot and provide live 
information about the closest parking lot with free spots. 

## Goals

- Display information about available parking spots
- Predict availability of parking spots soon to be available and communicate that to other drivers
